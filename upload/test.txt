Rescue teams searching for two climbers missing for more than a month on Ben Nevis have recovered the bodies of a man and a woman.Experienced climbers Tim Newton, 27, and Rachel Slater, 24, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, were reported missing on 15 February after failing to return from a weekend climb.Multiple searches by rescue teams have been carried out for them ever since, with some efforts hampered by hazardous weather and avalanche risks.Police  said: “Following a report from a member of the public, the bodies of a man and a woman have been recovered in the Ben Nevis area this evening. Formal identification is taking place and the families of missing climbers Rachel Slater and Tim Newton have been informed.”The alarm was raised for the pair on Monday 15 February when they were reported to be overdue in returning from an expedition. It was believed they had been camping in a green tent behind the Charles Inglis Clark memorial hut on the north side of the mountain.A hunt was launched, involving police, mountain rescue teams and search and rescue dogs, as fears for their safety grew. Climbers and walkers in the area were also called on to share information with officials to help with the search and they readily exchanged information on climbing forums and social media sites.But severe weather – including sub-zero temperatures, high winds and falling snow – hampered search efforts in the early stages.This week, it emerged that an ice axe had been found below the Shroud/Boomers Requiem area, where mountain rescuers have been searching for the couple. Slater was a graduate of Manchester University and employed as an environmental consultant near Bradford. She spent some time living and climbing in Canada, where her parents are still based. Newton, originally from Leicester, studied physics at Manchester and Leeds universities. He joined Hinckley  Club in Leicestershire in 2010 before he moved away to university, with fellow climbers there calling him a natural. Their families have previously praised the overwhelming response from members of the public and the climbing community in helping to search for the two. News of the discovery of two bodies sparked a flurry of responses on social media. Writing on Police Scotland’s Highlands and Islands Facebook page, Laura MacDonald said: “Such sad news for all involved. Big respect for the mountain rescue team who searched for them tirelessly in all weathers. Rest in peace xxx” Christine Hogg wrote: “Such sad news but hopefully their families will have some closure now and will at least be able to lay them to rest. Well done to the searchers who have worked tirelessly to find them. RIP and condolences to their families. xx” Fi Fox said: “Very sad news. RIP thoughts are with family and friends.” Karen Blanchard added: “Prayers with the families.”Lochaber mountain rescue team, who recovered the bodies, posted a tribute to the couple online. They said: “I am sure that everyone will join us in offering our thoughts and sincere condolences to the families and friends of Rachel and Tim. They were well-known, experienced and respected climbers and their plight has touched so many people over the last few weeks. “We have been overwhelmed by the help and support we have received over the last few weeks as we tried to get some clues to where Rachel and Tim may have been going on the day they went missing. We would like to thank the whole climbing community for engaging and assisting, even when it was only to eliminate some of the small clues we thought we had obtained.” The team also thanked Police Scotland and other mountain rescue and search teams involved.
